# SleepUino the DIY Alarm-Clock with Web-Interface based on ESP8266
The SleepUino is a DIY Alarm-Clock with a Web-Interface based on a ESP8266. It is using jQuery Mobile as Web UI. From this point of view it can be configured by any WiFi device, like Android/iOS mobile phones or a PC and Notebook with WLAN. The SleepUino is using the WLAN only for configuration (Nobody will have an access point beside the bed, I hope so!). It is generating its own WLAN access point, which you can use to connect with you smartphone or PC. Because the SleepUino is using a Single Web Application and a Captive Portal it is very easy to connecting with it. More details you can find on my German Web Page:

# Why a Web-Interface and jQuery Mobile for a Alarm-Clock?
The Web-Interface give me the possibility to get a lot of different configurations (**this is also true for many other devices**). And a Web-Interface can be used by any WLAN device independently of the operating system. The ESP8266 is a low cost micro controller, so the Web-Interface is bargain at that price! It is very easy to configure a Alarm-Clock by a Web-Interface as with many buttons on the Alarm-Clock itself. The SleepUino has only one button and this is fully enough to use it. [jQuery Mobile](https://jquerymobile.com/): *"is a user interface system designed to make responsive web sites and apps that are accessible on all smartphone, tablet and desktop devices"*. jQuery Mobile saves me a lot of time to get a single, responsive Web-Application, that's why I am using jQuery Mobile. According to the motte: *"Don't reinvent the wheel!"*. ðŸ˜‰

# A video said more than milles of words

# Currently Features
- The Display can be enabled or disabled in the configuration. Flowing option are available:
  - is on the whole time
  - is off the whole time
  - is off during bed time
  - is off during day time
- with a long button pressure you will start the configuration mode, the SleepUino access point is starting and you can connecting you WLAN device with SleepUino for configuration
- In confuration Mode

# WLAN without password protection! My security point of view:
* the WLAN is only available if you configure the SleepUino
* the webserver used by SleepUino can only handle one connection with a client
* so, yes there is a little chance, that any other is connecting with the SleepUino at the time when it is in configuration mode
* It is also possible to set a password for the Sleep Uino access point in the code, currently a password is not used. I see no dire necessity to do this because a password complicates the currently easy connecting process. If you have an other opinion share the arguments with me or change the code local for you.
